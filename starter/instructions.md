Add the insttructions below after the last bullet point under the API creastion section. The last bullet point is: 
> * Write 3 unit tests to test the API (one for the GET and two for POST, one that tests each prediction). 

- Run sanity check for your test cases:
    - Run `python sanitycheck.py`. This script is located inside the `starter` directory in the starter code.
    - The script will scan the test cases written for the `GET()` and `POST()` APIs and generate a report. 
    - The report will list any problems it detects with your test cases. Fix the problems and run the `sanitycheck.py` script again.
    - The script uses heuristics to detect common problems and can sometimes overlook a problem or raise a false alarm. You should still check your implementation against the project rubric to be absolutely sure your submission will meet the requirements.

Add the instructions below at the end of section **II. You do not have test cases for every possible output value of your model.**
- You should have run the `sanitycheck.py` script to catch any of the common problems with test cases. Instructions to run the script are on the Instructions page.
